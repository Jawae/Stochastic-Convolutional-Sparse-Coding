The algorithms were tested on MATLAB R2016a.

Please run main.m in SBCSC (batch mode) or SOCSC (online mode) on toy examples.

On a Core i7 machine, SBCSC takes around 140 seconds and the comparable method takes 300 seconds for 12 iterations. SOCSC takes 70 seconds and the comparable mthod takes around 440 seconds to process all 10 images.

In the file folder "filters", we include the over-complete dictionary reported in the manuscript.
